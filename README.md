##  Project Overview

This project explores loan application data to understand the factors that influence customer credit scores. Using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Hypothesis Testing**, the study uncovers financial and behavioral patterns such as income distribution, outstanding debt, number of bank accounts, credit inquiries, and payment behaviors.

The analysis highlights which features strongly impact credit scores and builds the foundation for future predictive modeling. Ultimately, this project aims to assist financial institutions in assessing risk more effectively and improving lending strategies.

##  Objectives

* Perform EDA to understand data distribution, skewness, and outliers.
* Use hypothesis testing to validate assumptions about key features.
* Identify significant factors influencing credit scores.
* Build a base for future predictive modeling.

---

##  Hypothesis Testing Performed

1. **Outliers & Multicollinearity Impact**

   * Tested whether features with outliers and correlated variables impact credit score.

2. **Income & Spending Habits vs Credit Score**

   * Checked if customer payment behavior significantly differs across credit score groups.

3. **Debt, Bank Accounts & Inquiries**

   * Validated whether high outstanding debt, multiple accounts, and frequent inquiries are strong indicators of poor credit scores.

---

## Insights from Analysis

* Income and monthly balances are skewed, with most customers earning/holding lower amounts.
* High spending and timely payments are linked to better credit scores.
* Customers with frequent inquiries and higher debt lean toward poor credit scores.
* Payment behavior has a statistically significant impact on credit score.

## üöÄ Future Scope

The next phase of this project will involve building a **classification model** to predict whether a customer‚Äôs credit score is **Good, Standard, or Poor**. Potential approaches include:

* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest
* Boosting Techniques (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)

This will make the project more practical for real-world lending decisions.
